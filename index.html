      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Research Scholar @ Technical University Berlin<br>
<a href="https://www.msc.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/">Chair of Mixed Signal Circuit Design</a></h3>
      <p style="text-align: center; padding: 5px 50px 75px 100px;">I am presently working as research assistant and pursuing my PhD at Chair of mixed signal circuit design. <br>Before joining as a PhD student , I was working as Scientist/Engineer'SC' at Control Digital Electronics Group (CDEG) ISRO Satellite Centre, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), India.<br> I completed my reserach fellow at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar, India and my master's from Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU),India.<br>My master thesis was on the "Implementation of genetic algorithms on ultra scale FPGAs to avoid single-event upset on deep space missions" with the main objective for Chandrayaan-2 mission.<br> My research interest includes deep learning accelerators and mixed VLSI design.</p>
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">My Experiances<br>Life in ISRO</h3>
      <p style="text-align: center; padding: 5px 50px 75px 100px;">ISRO is one of the most popular names in the country. The company which started from the grass root level is now grown into a gigantic organisation of 20000 employees. ISRO caters to the need of the country in terms of communication, remote sensing and military applications by launching 10-12 satellites per year. In addition to this deep space exploration is also undertaken in missions like Chandrayaan-1 and 2, Mangalyaan, Aditya-L1 and Astrosat. My life in ISRO started on 27th July 2015, on the day when India lost its most revered son, the former alumni of the company which I was joining, the people's president  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam">Dr A.P.J Abdul Kalam .</a> Before joining here, I had offers from two well known silicon companies . But the biggest motivation for joining ISRO was the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Orbiter_Mission"> Mangalyaan Mission (Mars Orbiter Mission) ,</a> where I had the urge to work with the top-most scientists of the country. I was allocted Control Digital Electronics Group (CDEG), the group which mainly works on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit">ASIC</a> based design to control the working operation of the satellite. Initial days were very tough as I was in my final year of master's and oscillating between the college and the office which were 22kms apart was a daunting task in Bangalore's traffic. One day, as I was going through the report of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrayaan-1">Chandrayaan-1</a> control unit, my boss called me for lunch. He spoke to me about the work I will be doing and discussed more about the master thesis which i will be doing in the office. After all the conversation, he asked me "Whether I am proud to work in ISRO as a scientist at the age of 23" and I quickly replied "Of course sir". To which he replied "There is no need to be proud of the company you work, it is more important for the company to be proud to have you in it". These words made me to work more harder and my bosses were super supportive, gave me required tips during my master thesis,exams and during the work.
Coming to the work culture, ISRO is a place for workholics unlike any other government organisations. The days will be busy before the final delivery of the spacecraft to the Sriharikota, technical review of your design will be tough with the chairman, centre directors and mission directors. Initial days will be tough to adjust, but later on with the mixture of young and experienced colleagues we begin to enjoy more and learn more. ISRO also has lot of collaborations with other space agencies like <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA ,</a><a href="https://www.esa.int/">ESA</a>  and <a href="https://global.jaxa.jp/">JAXA ,</a> so many times the challenges in the work will be more with long work hours. However at the end, it is every worth to work in the country's most premier organisation and we are serving the nation every second without guarding the border and holding the gun.</p>
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Life in TU Berlin and Germany</h3>
      <p style="text-align: center; padding: 5px 50px 75px 100px;">Thought of doing the PhD came to me, once one of my colleague joined <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/">Caltech for his doctorate .</a> So I took a mandatory IELTS and cleared it with 8.5/9. Then I started writing the emails to the professor's who were specialized in VLSI design who were in the top-50 universities of the <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2019/engineering-technology">QS world rankings .</a> Initially I didn't receive any response from them, later on I rewrote the email with the same thread about the specalization I was looking for and the research I wanted to perform in their chair and how will it be different from the present state of art by citing few of their publications. Then I received few offers from Imperial College London, KU Leuven, TU Berlin etc. Later on I accepted TU Berlin and joined the chair of mixed signal circuit design under the professor Friedel Gerfers on 1st Feburary 2017.

I started on working with the digital VLSI design and completed my first tapeout on January 2018 by implementing the direct digital synthesizer (DDS) in 22nm FDSOI for RF-DAC in automotive ethernet application and now I am presently working on deep learning accelerators with compression based techniques for embedded mobile applications. The valuable lessons which i learnt from PhD until now were: We need to take initiative to learn new things, being a good team player, passion to achieve something new and have high enthusiasm to work long hours, possess tremendous confidence to showcase your work, proper networking with other researchers working in the same domain and have good lingustic and writing skills. In addition to this it is important to remain fit both mentally and physically, so I suggest everyone to pursue their hobby and go to the gym regularly.

Finally, Europe is a best place to live with perfect work and life balance. If you are a traveller like me, you enjoy every bit of tourism here. Romantic spots ranges from Eiffel tower of Paris to The Cinque Terre of Liguria,Italy. Hiking places from Alps to Tour de Mont Blanc, France. The most famous beaches ranges from Pasjaca beach,Croatia to Cala Sa Boadella,Spain.
